        Full stack development involves working on both the front end and back end of a web application.
        This includes dealing with databases, server-side scripting, client-side scripting, and everything in between.

        As a full stack developer, you need to have a good understanding of various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Node.js, Express.js, React (or other front-end libraries/frameworks), and databases like MongoDB.
